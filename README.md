Week 1 homework code refactor

Being semantically sound in your HTML code is very important for accessibility purposes and ensuring that screen readers can deliver the content on the web page
in an easy to understand way.

The following file has been updated in both the HTML and the CSS. The HTML was updated with more specific container tags and added alt attributes to the pictures
while the CSS was reformmated to follow the same structure and layout of the web page as well as consolidated many of the classes and specified certain
parts of the webpage with classes instead of general selectors.

The webpage looks exactly the same as initial and all links are now functioning correctly.

***NOTE***
The initial repository for this project with all commits and updates had to be deleted and remade due to an issue with getting the webpage to display through the github page link. This was due to an issue with folders that has now been fixed.
